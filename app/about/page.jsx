          Future African Scientist (FAS) is a non-profit organization founded in
          2020 to equip early career scientists and undergraduate, as well as
          upper-secondary students in Africa, with the skills, infrastructure,
          and network they need to solve Africaâ€™s most pressing challenges. FAS
          partners with leading scientists from reputable research organizations
          and institutes to offer both virtual and in-person training in
          scientific research and entrepreneurship to the most promising young
          scientists in Africa. All students who graduate from FAS become part
          of a lifelong network of scientists in healthcare, agriculture, and
          artificial intelligence, where they are continuously matched with
          opportunities(jobs, internships) to work on real-world projects and
          learn from industry experts.
